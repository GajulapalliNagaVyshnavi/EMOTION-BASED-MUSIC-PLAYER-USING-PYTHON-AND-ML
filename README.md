This project aims to enhance music players by using emotion recognition to automate song selection based on user feelings. Utilizing facial emotion recognition, voice recognition, and text input, the system identifies emotions such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, and neutral. An algorithm then suggests tracks that match these emotions, improving the listening experience. This innovation in emotion-based music selection seeks to advance the machine learning field and provide a more personalized and therapeutic music experience.
